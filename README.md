## The Project
The following project was split into 2 parts:
- [2.5D SDL CXX scene](https://github.com/Brejvinder/COMP-3520-Project/tree/master/SDL2TemplateCMake)
- [3D OpenGL Rust scene](https://github.com/Brejvinder/COMP-3520-Project/tree/master/spinning_cube)

Each part has their own dedicated README.md file explaining notes on the implementation and how to run each part of the demo.
